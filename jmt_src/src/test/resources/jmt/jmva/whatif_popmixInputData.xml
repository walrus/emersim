<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?><model xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="JMTmodel.xsd"><description><![CDATA[This model (closed network with three stations and two classes of customers) allows the users to investigate the performance behavior with respect the mix of customers (i.e., the percentage of the customers of the two classes) in execution. 
The two classes have different bottleneck stations. The natural bottleneck of Class 1 is station 2 (max service demand = 6) , the natural bottleneck of Class 2 is station 3 (max service demand = 5). The control parameter of the what-if is the population mix: the percentage of class 1 customers varies between 0.05% and 0.95% in 19 steps. 
Execute the model. At the end of the execution select the performance indices in the "graphical results". 
Select the "utilization" at  "aggregate" level of stations 1, 2, and 3 and you will see that the bottleneck of the system switch from station 3 to station 2 when the % of class 1 jobs is about at 38%. Select the other indices (e.g., the system response time) and you will see very interesting behaviors. For example, the "aggregate throughput" has a parabolic shape with the maximum value corresponding to a mix of 40% of class 1 jobs. ]]></description><parameters><classes number="2"><closedclass name="Class1" population="10"/><closedclass name="Class2" population="10"/></classes><stations number="3"><listation name="Station1" servers="1"><servicetimes><servicetime customerclass="Class1">1.0</servicetime><servicetime customerclass="Class2">4.0</servicetime></servicetimes><visits><visit customerclass="Class1">1.0</visit><visit customerclass="Class2">1.0</visit></visits></listation><listation name="Station2" servers="1"><servicetimes><servicetime customerclass="Class1">6.0</servicetime><servicetime customerclass="Class2">1.0</servicetime></servicetimes><visits><visit customerclass="Class1">1.0</visit><visit customerclass="Class2">1.0</visit></visits></listation><listation name="Station3" servers="1"><servicetimes><servicetime customerclass="Class1">1.0</servicetime><servicetime customerclass="Class2">5.0</servicetime></servicetimes><visits><visit customerclass="Class1">1.0</visit><visit customerclass="Class2">1.0</visit></visits></listation></stations></parameters><whatIf className="Class1" type="Population Mix" values="0.05;0.1;0.15000000000000002;0.2;0.25;0.30000000000000004;0.35000000000000003;0.4;0.45;0.5;0.55;0.6000000000000001;0.65;0.7000000000000001;0.75;0.8;0.8500000000000001;0.9;0.9500000000000001"/></model>
